## Description

Flex-Dice is a single-player dice game where players compete against an AI opponent in a fun, fast-paced version of the popular game Left, Right, Center (LRC). The objective is simple: roll the dice, manage your chips, and be the last player with remaining chips to win. Flex-Dice combines the classic mechanics of LRC with the challenge of playing against a dynamic AI, offering an exciting experience that tests both your luck and strategy. Whether you're playing for fun or aiming to beat the AI, Flex-Dice guarantees an engaging and unpredictable gameplay experience!

By building this game, we wanted to offer an easily accessible, fun, and competitive gaming experience without needing other players, allowing people to enjoy the thrill of the game anytime, anywhere.

## Usage

Click the sign up button to create a user if you havent already. You will then be redirected to login and select an avatar. Selecting an avatar is prompted at every login to allow users to change their avatar. Following this, users will be redirected to a rules page that also has a users stats button. Once the user has learned the rules and is ready to play, they can press begin game at the right of the nav bar. Users are located at the top of the game table and play against four AI players. Clicking the blue "Roll Dice" button in the middle starts your turn and the other players will automatically take their turns and divvy out chips in a clockwise fashion. Repeat until a player wins and the game ends. Upon which, the user will be prompted to play again. Users can logout at anytime. There is functionality for a game log to display what players rolled and who gave chips to which player. There is also functionality for a live chat where a user can create, join, and convey messages. Multiplayer functionality is in development.
